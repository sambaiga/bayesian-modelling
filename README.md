## Setting Up the Project

Follow these steps to quickly install all dependencies and set up the working environment.

1. Install uv
If you don't already have uv, install it using the recommended method:

```Bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Alternatively, you can install it via pipx.
```bash 
pipx install uv
```

2. Sync Dependencies
Navigate to the root directory of the project  and run.
```bash
 uv sync
```
This will create a virtual environment and install all necessary dependencies.
